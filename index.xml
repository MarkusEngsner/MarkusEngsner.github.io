      <description>Welcome! My name is Markus Engsner, and this is my personal website. Here I showcase things I make, as well as write about things that I happen to find interesting.
I spend most of my spare time programming, as well as building various electronic gadgets and robots. Currently I&amp;rsquo;m mostly doing various programming challenges. You can find some of the solutions on my Github (linked on the left). I have experience in the programming languages C++, C and Python.</description>

      <description>I bought this domain back in November last year, but I never ended up doing anything with it, due in part to me trying to make it from scratch with Django. However, I finally caved in and realized that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t ever be finished that way. Therefore, I have decided to run it using the Hugo framework instead.
The plan is to post the various projects I decide to tackle in my spare time, as well as whatever else comes to mind.</description>
