      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome! My name is Markus Engsner, and this is my personal website.
Here I showcase things I make, as well as write about things that I happen to find interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend most of my spare time programming, as well as building various electronic gadgets and robots.
Currently I&amp;rsquo;m mostly doing various programming challenges.
You can find some of the solutions on my Github (linked on the left).
I have experience in the programming languages C++, C and Python.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A new beginning</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I bought this domain back in November last year, but I never ended up doing anything with it,
due in part to me trying to make it from scratch with Django.
However, I finally caved in and realized that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t ever be finished that way.
Therefore, I have decided to run it using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; framework instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is to post the various projects I decide to tackle in my spare time,
as well as whatever else comes to mind.
Only time will tell what actually ends up happening though!&lt;/p&gt;
