      <description>Welcome! My name is Markus Engsner, and this is my personal website. Here I showcase things I make, as well as write about things that I happen to find interesting.
I spend most of my spare time programming, as well as building various electronic gadgets and robots. Currently I&amp;rsquo;m mostly doing various programming challenges. You can find some of the solutions on my Github (linked on the left). I have experience in the programming languages C++, C and Python.</description>
