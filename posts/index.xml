      <description>I bought this domain back in November last year, but I never ended up doing anything with it, due in part to me trying to make it from scratch with Django. However, I finally caved in and realized that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t ever be finished that way. Therefore, I have decided to run it using the Hugo framework instead.
The plan is to post the various projects I decide to tackle in my spare time, as well as whatever else comes to mind.</description>
